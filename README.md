# Snake
A snake game using Pygame I submitted as a project on December 8 2021 when I was taking ICS2OG in Grade 9 at Richmond Hill High School. 

In addition to the base snake game, I implemented two player mode, obstacle mode, and a strategy mode. There is also an intricate menu system.

Music was downloaded off of Youtube.
